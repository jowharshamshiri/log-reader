# Log Mask VS Code Extension

## Overview

Log Mask is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance your log file viewing experience. It provides a custom editor for log files with a masking feature that allows you to focus on important information and ignore redundant content.

## Features

- **Custom Log Viewer**: A specialized editor for `.log` files.
- **Toggle Mask**: Easily switch between the original log view and a masked view that highlights changes.
- **Change Highlighting**: In the masked view, repeated content is replaced with a placeholder character, making it easy to spot differences between log entries.
- **Seamless Integration**: The extension adds a toggle button to the editor title bar for quick access to the masking feature.

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Log Mask"
4. Click on the "Install" button

Alternatively, you can install the extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

## Usage

1. Open any `.log` file in VS Code.
2. The file will automatically open in the Log Mask custom editor.
3. You'll see a new "Toggle Log Mask" button in the editor title bar (it looks like an eye icon).
4. Click the button to toggle between the original view and the masked view.
5. In the masked view, repeated content is replaced with a placeholder character (default is 'â–‘'), making changes easy to spot.
